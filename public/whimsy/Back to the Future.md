# Connections Between *Back to the Future* and Donald Trump

## 1. Biff Tannen as a Trump Parallel
- In *Back to the Future Part II* (1989), Biff Tannen is shown in an alternate 1985 as a corrupt, wealthy tycoon who turns Hill Valley into a dystopia.
- His look and empire—gaudy tower, golden decor, casino ownership—were modeled on Donald Trump.
- Screenwriter Bob Gale confirmed that Biff’s “Pleasure Paradise Casino & Hotel” was inspired by Trump’s Atlantic City casinos.
- Even Biff’s speech patterns in this timeline mirror Trump’s brash persona.

## 2. Production Context: 1980s Trump Image
- During the late 1980s, Trump was a cultural symbol of greed and excess.
- His book *The Art of the Deal* (1987) and frequent media appearances made him shorthand for unrestrained capitalism.
- The filmmakers leaned into this archetype when shaping Biff’s alternate future persona.

## 3. Trump and Nostalgia Politics
- The trilogy explores nostalgia for the 1950s and anxieties about the future.
- Trump’s political rhetoric (“Make America Great Again”) similarly invokes a simplified, mythic past.
- Both the films and Trump’s message rely on cultural memory and idealized visions of earlier decades.

## 4. Trump Towers and Biff Towers
- Biff’s casino skyscraper in Part II resembles Trump Plaza and Trump Tower, with gold trim and branding.
- Production designers drew inspiration directly from Trump’s real estate projects.

## 5. The “Alternate 1985” as Political Satire
- Biff’s dystopian Hill Valley illustrates how corrupt wealth reshapes society.
- After Trump’s election in 2016, many observers compared “Biff’s America” to Trump’s rise.
- The film retroactively became seen as accidental political prophecy.
