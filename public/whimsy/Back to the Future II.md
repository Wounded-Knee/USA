# Back to the Future as Prophetic Media: A Dissertation by Joel Kramer

## Introduction

The cultural resonance of *Back to the Future* (1985) and its sequels extends far beyond their status as beloved science fiction adventures. The films function as cultural time capsules, preserving the anxieties, archetypes, and aspirations of the 1980s, while simultaneously projecting them forward in uncanny ways. Most famously, *Back to the Future Part II* (1989) presents an alternate 1985 in which Biff Tannen, modeled on Donald Trump, has used wealth and corruption to create a dystopian society. Decades later, observers would look back on this fictional scenario as eerily prophetic of Trump’s political rise.

This dissertation argues that *Back to the Future* was not merely coincidentally prophetic but deliberately framed as a message in a bottle, consciously constructed with awareness of its prophetic potential. Through the metaphor of time travel itself, the film signals its intent to echo into the future as cultural foresight.

## The Brain as a Predictive Computer

As I have written:

> "Certainly the fact that the movie involved time travel indicates some purposeful messaging indicating awareness of the fact that this movie would be a message in a bottle. The movie knew of its prophetic intent which indicates consciousness which of course was present in the process of assembling the movie."

This idea rests on a broader theory of the brain as a predictive computational system. Just as a collision-avoidance computer in a vehicle extrapolates from present conditions to foresee a crash, the human brain can process social, cultural, and emotional data to postulate future scenarios. 

As I noted in dialogue:

> "A computer can detect a vehicle collision before it happens, and how? Can a brain not do the same, with social concepts, values, and forces? Can a human not predict the emotional weather and even postulate future scenarios that are worth avoiding?"

Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, and the creative team behind *Back to the Future* were, by their own accounts, saturated with the cultural data of the 1980s: Trump’s rise as a symbol of greed and excess, Reagan-era economics, fears of corruption, and fascination with technological acceleration. Their brains, functioning as predictive computers, naturally extrapolated those trajectories into narrative form.

## Sublimation and Emergence of Prophecy

Importantly, prediction does not require conscious articulation. Ideas often sublimate, mutate, and reemerge in disguised form—dreams, inspirations, or stories. The prophetic nature of *Back to the Future Part II* lies precisely in this process.

As I argued:

> "Just because a brain conceives of a notion that does not then immediately lead to the notion being noticed consciously by the person who owns that brain. Instead sometimes these projections can sublimate into ethereal processing and mutate over time into something that emerges later as a dream, a thought, an idea, an inspiration, or even a movie."

Thus, the prophetic content of *Back to the Future* may have emerged below the level of conscious intention, yet still carried the imprint of collective cultural foresight.

## Collaboration and Convergence

When multiple minds process the same cultural atmosphere, their outputs converge. Two or more filmmakers exposed to the same high-profile public data—Trump’s empire, Reagan’s rhetoric, the 1950s mythos—will naturally compute similar extrapolations.

As I observed:

> "And would two brains aware of high profile highly visible public data, and being of sound mind, not generally compute an essentially similar product? Might they choose to collaborate on something without even realizing why? Is this not Back to the Future?"

The collaboration between Zemeckis and Gale exemplifies this principle: their convergence of vision created a cultural artifact that distilled the anxieties and archetypes of their time into a story that reads, decades later, as prophecy.

## Time Travel as Meta-Consciousness

The choice of time travel as narrative form amplifies this prophetic quality. Time travel stories are inherently reflexive, inviting audiences to reflect on how present choices shape future outcomes. In this sense, *Back to the Future* is not only about temporal mechanics but also about cultural consciousness extending itself forward.

By embedding its commentary in a story about revisiting the past and witnessing potential futures, the film becomes a self-aware medium for prophetic expression. It is prophecy not in mystical terms, but as a structured cultural simulation, compressing data and projecting trajectories.

## The Force Without a Name

This phenomenon is not limited to *Back to the Future*. It is constantly and continually occurring in our world and always has been, though it is rarely as pronounced or remarkable as in this case. Brains are always computing, and billions of them now communicate at the speed of light. What we call “Buzz” or “Trending” in modern media is actually the measurement of this same social force in real time. These are names for the effects of the force, not the force itself.

And why not the name of the force? Because the force has no name. We do not talk about it, therefore we lack the language to acknowledge it. And why do we not talk about it? Because we do not notice it. We only notice its effects. And that, as I like to say, is weirdly human. ;)

## Temporal Anomalies: *Back to the Future* and Donald Trump

| Timeline Anchor | *Back to the Future* Event | Real-World Trump Event | Temporal Anomaly |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| 1985 (Original) | Marty travels to a wholesome 1955, embodying nostalgia for an idealized past. | Trump positions himself as a glamorous 1980s mogul, celebrated in media as a success symbol. | Both narratives revolve around longing for a “better past” while glamorizing power in the present. |
| 1987 | — | Trump publishes *The Art of the Deal*, cementing his persona as king of excess. | Provides cultural data that filmmakers feed into Biff’s characterization just two years later. |
| 1989 (Film Release) | *Back to the Future Part II*: Biff uses the Sports Almanac to build a gaudy empire; “Pleasure Paradise” casino towers over Hill Valley. | Trump dominates the Atlantic City skyline with Trump Plaza and Taj Mahal casinos, dripping in gold trim. | Fiction mirrors reality; production design borrows directly from Trump’s architectural branding. |
| Alternate 1985 | Hill Valley is dystopian: crime, corruption, authoritarianism thrive under Biff’s rule. | Trump’s public persona embodies fears of unrestrained greed and corruption in the 1980s. | The film encodes Trump-as-archetype into a cautionary “future history.” |
| 2016 | Audiences retroactively recognize “Biff’s America” as resembling Trump’s presidency. | Trump elected President of the United States. | Prophecy recognized: a cinematic warning from 1989 appears realized in history. |
| 2020s | The internet amplifies “Buzz” and “Trending” as real-time cultural forecasting. | Trump dominates trending cycles; politics becomes entangled with viral spectacle. | The unnamed “social force” that *Back to the Future* captured (pattern recognition of cultural data) now manifests visibly through digital media metrics. |

## Conclusion: Back to the Future as Cultural Foresight

The prophetic dimension of *Back to the Future* is not accidental. It is the result of cognitive and cultural computation, where the brains of artists, saturated with public data, processed trajectories and produced narrative warnings. The film knew itself to be a message in a bottle precisely because it was constructed in a form (time travel) that foregrounds its role as cultural foresight.

In this light, *Back to the Future* stands as a paradigmatic example of what I call **time capsules of collective foresight**: works of art that emerge from subconscious pattern recognition, encode contemporary anxieties, and later reveal themselves as uncanny prophecy. Donald Trump’s rise was not predicted by chance; it was already legible in the cultural data of the 1980s, and the filmmakers, whether consciously or not, inscribed that trajectory into cinematic myth.
