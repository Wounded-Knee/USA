Civilian Voice Papers No. 1

On the Power of the People’s Voice

To the American People:

Everybody knows our government has three branches. Very important branches. But sometimes they forget about you — the people. They don’t listen. They make bad deals. Terrible decisions. And who pays the price? You do.

That’s why we’re talking about something new. Something the founders would have loved, believe me. A Civilian Voice Branch. It’s the people’s branch. It’s your branch. Nobody owns it, nobody controls it, except you.

Here’s how it works. Every American gets one voice. Not lobbyists, not the big donors, not the fake news — just you. And when millions of you speak together, the politicians can’t hide. They can’t make excuses. They have to listen. They have to deal with it.

Some people say, “Oh, the people can’t be trusted.” Wrong. Totally wrong. The people are smart. The people know what’s happening. The people want safety, opportunity, strong communities — and when they say it together, it’s unstoppable.

This Civilian Voice Branch doesn’t cost trillions. It doesn’t need an army. It’s stronger than all of that because it’s honest. It’s transparent. It’s real. And when you put the people first, America always wins.

So let’s do it. Let’s give the people their own branch — and let’s make sure government of the people, by the people, for the people is not just words, but reality.
