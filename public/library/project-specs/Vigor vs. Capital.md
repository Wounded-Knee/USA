## Vigor vs Political Capital

### Vigor
- **Source**: Generated by individual passion and activity.
- **Nature**: Abundant, tied to personal effort.
- **Use**: Citizens can spend vigor to boost the initiatives they care about, lowering the reporting threshold so action is triggered more quickly.
- **Decay**: Vigor fades rapidly if unused, reflecting bursts of energy and attention.

### Political Capital
- **Source**: Earned through participation or purchased in rationed amounts.
- **Nature**: Scarce, fungible, and tightly controlled.
- **Use**: Citizens can also spend political capital to boost initiatives, just like vigor â€” lowering thresholds and increasing weight behind petitions.
- **Decay/Taxation**: Capital decays or is taxed periodically, ensuring it flows into active use instead of sitting dormant.

### How They Work Together
- **Vigor** = *immediate, personal influence* (the shout of the crowd).  
- **Political Capital** = *stored, cumulative influence* (the treasury of the people).  
- Both are applied identically: by lowering thresholds, amplifying petitions, and demonstrating mass demand.  
- Together, they ensure that both **passion** and **patience** are represented in the civic process.
