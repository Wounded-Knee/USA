# Data Model Refactor Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the comprehensive data model refactor that addresses the core relationship constraints and improves data consistency.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Core Relationship Model

âœ… **User** creates **Petition**
âœ… **User** casts exactly one **Vote** per **Petition** (enforced by unique compound index)
âœ… **Vigor** always points to **Vote** and **User** (with validation that vigor.user matches vote.user)
âœ… **Position** references **Office** and **User** (via PositionTerm)
âœ… **PositionTerm** records time slices for clean history

### 2. New Models Created

#### User Model (`server/models/User.js`)
- Replaced role strings with Role references
- Implemented `authProviders` array for OAuth and local auth
- Added proper indexing for common queries
- Compound unique index for auth providers

#### Role Model (`server/models/Role.js`)
- New model for role-based access control
- Includes scopes for fine-grained permissions
- Supports role hierarchy and descriptions

#### Petition Model (`server/models/Petition.js`)
- Removed mutable counters (`voteCount`, `totalVigor`)
- Added `snapshot` structure for optional cached counts
- References `categoryId` instead of string category
- Added proper indexing for performance

#### PetitionMetrics Model (`server/models/PetitionMetrics.js`)
- Materialized view for analytics counts
- Single source of truth for vote and vigor statistics
- Supports trending score calculations

#### Vote Model (`server/models/Vote.js`)
- Unique bridge between User and Petition
- Enforces one vote per user per petition
- Includes signing statement and active status

#### Vigor Model (`server/models/Vigor.js`)
- Always attached to a Vote, never directly to Petition
- Pre-validation hook ensures vigor.user matches vote.user
- Supports multiple vigor types (steps, calories, duration, etc.)

#### Government Hierarchy Models
- **Jurisdiction**: Materialized path via `ancestors` array
- **GoverningBody**: Slug unique within jurisdiction
- **Office**: Slug unique within governing body
- **Position**: Represents the seat (separate from office holder)
- **PositionTerm**: Records time slices with overlap prevention

#### Legislation Model (`server/models/Legislation.js`)
- Uniqueness per governing body and bill number
- Comprehensive status tracking
- Proper indexing for legislative queries

#### Media Model (`server/models/Media.js`)
- Single polymorphic reference via `entityType` and `entityId`
- Supports all entity types (User, Petition, Government entities)
- Proper indexing for media queries

#### Taxonomy Model (`server/models/Taxonomy.js`)
- Controlled categories and tags
- Supports hierarchical organization
- Replaces hardcoded category strings

### 3. Validation and Constraints

âœ… **Votes**: Unique compound index `(user, petition)` blocks duplicates
âœ… **Vigor**: Pre-validate hook verifies `vigor.user === vote.user`
âœ… **PositionTerm**: Constraint prevents overlapping terms for same position
âœ… **Slugs**: Unique within parent scope (jurisdiction, governing body, office)

### 4. Index Strategy

- **Common list views**: jurisdiction + status + createdAt
- **Vote queries**: user + createdAt, petition + createdAt
- **Vigor queries**: vote + createdAt, user + createdAt
- **Media queries**: entityType + entityId + createdAt
- **Government queries**: parent + slug uniqueness

### 5. Migration Tools

#### MigrationManager (`server/utils/migration.js`)
- Creates default roles and taxonomy
- Migrates users from old role strings to role references
- Migrates petitions from category strings to categoryId references
- Creates initial PetitionMetrics from existing data

#### Migration Script (`server/scripts/run-migration.js`)
- Executable script for running migrations
- Available via `npm run migrate`
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Schema Updates
1. âœ… Update all models with new schemas
2. âœ… Add new models (Role, PetitionMetrics, PositionTerm, etc.)
3. âœ… Remove old fields and references

### Phase 2: Data Migration
1. âœ… Create default roles and taxonomy
2. âœ… Migrate users to new role structure
3. âœ… Migrate petitions to new category structure
4. âœ… Create initial metrics from existing data

### Phase 3: API Updates (Next Steps)
1. ðŸ”„ Update API routes to use new models
2. ðŸ”„ Implement new validation schemas
3. ðŸ”„ Update response formats
4. ðŸ”„ Add new endpoints for PositionTerm management

### Phase 4: Frontend Updates (Next Steps)
1. ðŸ”„ Update components to use new data structures
2. ðŸ”„ Implement new form validations
3. ðŸ”„ Update display logic for new relationships
4. ðŸ”„ Add new UI for PositionTerm management

## Benefits of the Refactor

### Data Consistency
- **Single source of truth** for all counts via PetitionMetrics
- **Enforced relationships** prevent orphaned data
- **Validation hooks** ensure data integrity

### Performance
- **Proper indexing** for common query patterns
- **Materialized views** for analytics
- **Eliminated counter drift** issues

### Scalability
- **Clean separation** of concerns
- **Flexible auth system** with OAuth support
- **Hierarchical government data** with materialized paths

### Maintainability
- **Clear relationship model** easier to understand
- **Consistent patterns** across all models
- **Migration tools** for future schema changes

## Next Steps

1. **Test the migration** with existing data
2. **Update API routes** to use new models
3. **Update frontend components** for new data structures
4. **Implement worker processes** for metrics updates
5. **Add comprehensive testing** for new relationships

## Running the Migration

```bash
# Run the migration script
npm run migrate

# Check the logs for any issues
# Verify data integrity after migration
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:
1. **Stop the application** immediately
2. **Restore from database backup**
3. **Review migration logs** for specific issues
4. **Fix the migration script** and retry
5. **Test with a copy** of production data first

## Conclusion

This refactor establishes a solid foundation for the application's data model with:
- **Clear relationships** that prevent data inconsistencies
- **Proper indexing** for optimal query performance
- **Flexible architecture** that supports future growth
- **Migration tools** for safe transitions

The new model enforces the business rules while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
