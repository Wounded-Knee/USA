# Government Entity Relationships Database Structure

## Overview

The Government Entity Relationships system provides a comprehensive hierarchical data model for representing the complete structure of government entities in the United States. This system uses MongoDB with Mongoose ODM to create a normalized, scalable representation of jurisdictions, governing bodies, offices, positions, and their relationships.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Structure
- **Materialized Paths**: Fast navigation through government hierarchies
- **Adjacency Lists**: Flexible parent-child relationships
- **Depth Tracking**: Efficient querying by hierarchy level
- **Unique Paths**: Ensures data integrity across hierarchies

### 2. Normalized Design
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct models for different entity types
- **Referential Integrity**: Proper foreign key relationships
- **Extensible Metadata**: Flexible data storage for future requirements
- **Identifier Support**: Standard government identifiers (OCD, FIPS, GEOID)

### 3. User Integration
- **Unified Person Model**: Uses existing User model for all person references
- **Position Tracking**: Links users to government positions
- **Voting Records**: Tracks legislative voting history
- **Committee Memberships**: Manages committee participation

## Database Models and Relationships

## Relationship Patterns

### 1. Hierarchical Relationships
**Jurisdiction Hierarchy**:
```
USA (federal)
├── California (state)
│   ├── San Mateo County (county)
│   │   ├── San Francisco (municipal)
│   │   └── Redwood City (municipal)
│   └── Los Angeles County (county)
└── New York (state)
```

**Governing Body Hierarchy**:
```
US Congress (federal legislative)
├── US Senate (federal legislative)
└── US House of Representatives (federal legislative)
```

### 2. Cross-Entity Relationships
**Office Assignment Patterns**:
- **Governing Body Offices**: Office → GoverningBody → Jurisdiction
- **Direct Jurisdiction Offices**: Office → Jurisdiction
- **District-Based Offices**: Office → District → Jurisdiction

**Position Assignment Patterns**:
- **Current Positions**: Position → Office → (GoverningBody|Jurisdiction)
- **Historical Positions**: Position → Election → Office
- **Voting Records**: GovernmentVote → Position → Office

### 3. Temporal Relationships
**Election Cycles**:
```
Election → Position → Office
├── term_start/term_end
├── is_current flag
└── status tracking
```

**Legislative Process**:
```
Legislation → Committee → GoverningBody
├── status progression
├── vote tracking
└── sponsor/cosponsor relationships
```

## Data Integrity Constraints

### 1. Unique Constraints
- **Jurisdiction**: `{ parent: 1, slug: 1 }` - Unique within parent
- **Governing Body**: `{ jurisdiction: 1, parent: 1, slug: 1 }` - Unique within jurisdiction
- **Office**: `{ governing_body: 1, slug: 1 }` or `{ jurisdiction: 1, slug: 1 }`
- **Position**: `{ office: 1, person: 1, term_start: 1 }` - Unique person per office per term
- **Election**: `{ office: 1, election_date: 1 }` - Unique election per office per date

### 2. Validation Rules
- **Office Relationships**: Must belong to either governing body OR jurisdiction, not both
- **Term Dates**: `term_end` must be after `term_start`
- **Election Dates**: Completed elections cannot have future dates
- **Path Generation**: Automatic path generation based on hierarchy

### 3. Referential Integrity
- **Cascade Considerations**: Deletion of parent entities affects children
- **Soft Deletes**: Considered for historical data preservation
- **Audit Trail**: Track all data modifications

## Query Patterns

### 1. Hierarchy Navigation
```javascript
// Get jurisdiction hierarchy
const hierarchy = await getJurisdictionHierarchy(jurisdictionId);

// Get governing body hierarchy
const bodies = await GoverningBody.find({ jurisdiction: jurisdictionId })
  .populate('parent')
  .sort({ depth: 1, name: 1 });
```

### 2. Current Office Holders
```javascript
// Get current positions for jurisdiction
const positions = await Position.find({
  'office.jurisdiction': jurisdictionId,
  is_current: true
}).populate('office person');
```

### 3. Voting Records
```javascript
// Get person's voting record
const votes = await GovernmentVote.find({ person: personId })
  .populate('legislation position')
  .sort({ vote_date: -1 });
```

### 4. Election Results
```javascript
// Get election results with candidates
const election = await Election.findById(electionId)
  .populate('candidates.person')
  .populate('office jurisdiction');
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Indexing Strategy
- **Hierarchy Indexes**: `{ parent: 1, slug: 1 }`, `{ path: 1 }`
- **Query Indexes**: `{ jurisdiction: 1, level: 1 }`, `{ branch: 1 }`
- **Temporal Indexes**: `{ term_start: 1, term_end: 1 }`, `{ election_date: 1 }`
- **Person Indexes**: `{ person: 1, is_current: 1 }`

### 2. Population Strategy
- **Selective Population**: Only populate required fields
- **Nested Population**: Handle complex relationship chains
- **Pagination**: Implement on all list endpoints

### 3. Caching Considerations
- **Hierarchy Cache**: Cache jurisdiction/governing body hierarchies
- **Current Positions**: Cache current office holders
- **Election Results**: Cache completed election results

## Integration Points

### 1. User System Integration
- **Person References**: All person references use User model
- **Authentication**: Leverages existing auth system
- **Profile Integration**: Government positions in user profiles

### 2. Petition System Integration
- **Jurisdiction Targeting**: Petitions can target specific jurisdictions
- **Office Targeting**: Petitions can target specific offices
- **Representative Lookup**: Find representatives for petition delivery

### 3. Voting System Integration
- **Legislative Votes**: Track government voting records
- **Public Votes**: Integrate with petition voting system
- **Vote Analysis**: Compare government vs public voting patterns

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Geographic Integration
- **GeoJSON Boundaries**: Store district boundaries
- **Spatial Queries**: Find jurisdictions by location
- **Map Integration**: Visual representation of government structure

### 2. Temporal Tracking
- **Historical Data**: Track changes over time
- **Version Control**: Maintain data history
- **Audit Trail**: Complete modification tracking

### 3. Advanced Analytics
- **Voting Patterns**: Analyze legislative voting trends
- **Representation Analysis**: Track representation demographics
- **Engagement Metrics**: Measure public interaction with government data

## Conclusion
