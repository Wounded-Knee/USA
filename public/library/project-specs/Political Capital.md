# The Political Capital Economic System

## Overview
Political Capital (PC) is a civic currency designed to give citizens a fungible, rationed, and renewable form of influence.  
It works alongside **Vigor**, the measure of immediate passion and energy, to power petitions and initiatives.  

Both Vigor and Political Capital lower the thresholds required for initiatives to trigger official responses.  
The difference lies in how they are earned, how scarce they are, and how long they last.

## Core Principles

1. **Every Voice Has Value**  
   Testimony, signatures, and engagement mint Political Capital and Vigor.  

2. **Scarcity Creates Weight**  
   Political Capital is rationed and capped; its scarcity makes each unit carry weight.  

3. **Fungibility of Influence**  
   Both Vigor and Political Capital can be spent toward lowering thresholds and boosting initiatives.  

4. **Renewable Consent**  
   Political Capital decays or is taxed over time, ensuring that influence reflects *current, living consent*.  

5. **Funding Democracy**  
   Political Capital can be purchased in rationed amounts, funding the system and its agents.  
   This allows wealth to support democracy, but never dominate it.

## Currencies of Influence

### Vigor
- **Source**: Generated by individual activity and passion (e.g., participation, attention, daily engagement).  
- **Nature**: Abundant, personal, and fast-decaying.  
- **Use**: Spent to lower petition thresholds on issues you care about.  
- **Analogy**: A shout in the crowd — immediate, powerful, but short-lived.  

### Political Capital
- **Source**:  
  - Earned through verified civic participation.  
  - Purchased in rationed amounts to fund system operations.  
- **Nature**: Scarce, tightly controlled, fungible, and durable compared to vigor.  
- **Use**: Also spent to lower petition thresholds — identical in function to vigor, but harder to accumulate.  
- **Controls**:  
  - **One person, one account** (identity verification).  
  - **Issuance rations** (per period limits).  
  - **Sliding scale pricing**: the more you bank, the more expensive it becomes to buy additional PC.  
- **Decay/Taxation**:  
  - Periodic “inflation” reduces balances over time.  
  - Encourages active use, prevents hoarding, recycles capital into the commons.  
- **Analogy**: A treasury of influence — rationed, long-term, powerful.

## How They Work Together

- **Petitions & Initiatives** begin with a set threshold of required support.  
- Citizens contribute **votes** (baseline support), then may spend **Vigor** or **Political Capital** to lower that threshold.  
- Both currencies are consumed in the same way — but they reflect different types of commitment.  

**Equation Example:**  

Effective Threshold = Base Threshold - (Vigor + Political Capital)

- A petition may require 10,000 voices.  
- Citizens expend 2,000 Vigor and 1,000 Political Capital.  
- New threshold = 7,000.  

This mechanism ensures both the **energy of the moment** and the **stored capital of the people** can accelerate action.

## System Metaphors

- **The Iron Canoe**: The platform itself, impossible to sink, carrying influence across turbulent waters.  
- **Silicon Wampum**: Each testimony a bead, strung together into belts of collective will.  
- **Rations of Power**: Like wartime bread, issued fairly and consumed actively.  
- **Living Capital**: Political Capital is alive, decaying if unused, embodying active consent.

## Benefits

### For Citizens
- Two complementary tools of influence: short-term passion (Vigor) and long-term capital (PC).  
- Assurance of fairness: no one can dominate the system through wealth alone.  
- Confidence that action thresholds can be reached faster with collective effort.  

### For Institutions
- A verifiable, transparent record of aggregated public will.  
- Stable funding from PC purchases supports democratic agents and operations.  
- Threshold triggers enforce accountability: officials must respond when levels are reached.  

### For Democracy
- Moves beyond symbolic voting to a **full civic economy**.  
- Converts raw voices into measurable, fungible influence.  
- Ensures politics reflects both **the fire of passion** and **the weight of accumulated will**.

## Conclusion
Political Capital and Vigor together create a dual-flow civic economy.  
- **Vigor** captures immediate intensity.  
- **Political Capital** preserves and rations enduring influence.  

Both can be spent to lower thresholds and drive petitions into action.  
Together, they make democracy a living, breathing economy where every voice counts, and collective will becomes undeniable.
