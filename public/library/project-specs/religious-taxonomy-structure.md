## Data Sources
- **Primary Source**: Pew Research Center Religious Landscape Study
- **Year**: 2025 estimates
- **Population**: United States only
- **Methodology**: Self-identification surveys

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- **Collection**: `identities` (with discriminator `ReligiousIdentity`)
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Uses `parentId` field for parent-child relationships
- **Unique Identifiers**: Numeric `id` field for efficient querying
- **Slugs**: URL-friendly identifiers for web routing

### Mock Data Structure
The Picker component includes comprehensive mock data that mirrors the database structure, allowing for:
- **Offline functionality** when API is unavailable
- **Development and testing** without database dependencies
- **Consistent user experience** across different environments

### Navigation Features
- **Hierarchical browsing** through parent-child relationships
- **Breadcrumb navigation** showing current path
- **Sibling navigation** allowing easy switching between related identities
- **Search functionality** with case-insensitive filtering
- **Panel persistence** when children or siblings are available

## Usage Examples

### Selecting a Religious Identity
1. **Top-level selection**: Choose "Christian" to see Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox options
2. **Denomination selection**: Choose "Protestant" to see Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, etc.
3. **Sub-denomination selection**: Choose "Baptist" to see Southern Baptist, American Baptist, etc.
4. **Final selection**: Choose "Southern Baptist" for the most specific identity

### Navigation Patterns
- **Drill-down**: Christian → Protestant → Baptist → Southern Baptist
- **Sibling switching**: Baptist → Methodist → Lutheran (all Protestant denominations)
- **Back navigation**: Use breadcrumbs to return to parent categories
- **Search**: Type "baptist" to find all Baptist-related identities

## Future Enhancements
- **Geographic variations** (regional religious preferences)
- **Historical data** (religious affiliation changes over time)
- **Demographic breakdowns** (age, education, income correlations)
- **Interfaith categories** (people identifying with multiple traditions)
- **Emerging traditions** (new religious movements and practices)

## Technical Notes
- **ID Format**: Uses hierarchical numbering (1, 1-1, 1-1-1, 1-1-1-1)
- **Population Estimates**: Updated annually based on latest survey data
- **Validation**: Parent-child relationships are validated to prevent circular references
- **Performance**: Indexed for efficient hierarchical queries
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate additional levels and categories as needed
