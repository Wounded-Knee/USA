Civilian Voice Papers No. 1

On the Necessity of a People’s Branch

To the People of the Republic:

Fellow citizens, our government was built on a simple, yet enduring truth: that it is the right of the people to be the source of all just power. The founders, in their wisdom, set up three branches to guard that truth. They have labored well through many trials. Yet time and experience have shown that even these great pillars may bend, and sometimes forget the very people from whom their strength is drawn.

If government of the people, by the people, and for the people is truly to endure, then the people must not speak only at long intervals, nor be heard only through officers once removed. They must be given a steady instrument of testimony, by which they may, in their millions, express their conscience and declare their will.

I speak, therefore, of a Civilian Voice Branch: not a body of legislators, nor a court, nor an executive office, but the constant record of the people themselves, made plain and visible to all. One citizen’s word may be overlooked. Ten may be set aside. But the living aggregate of a whole people, recorded and preserved, cannot be denied.

This Branch holds no armies. It levies no tax. Its strength lies in truth, and in the dignity of a free people making known their judgment. It is the people’s podium, open at every hour. It is their right of petition, magnified until no ear in authority may claim not to hear it.

Some will ask, “Will not the multitude err?” Yes, men are fallible, and the people are no exception. But I say again what I have said before: the people, when given the truth, can be trusted to meet any national crisis. The great danger lies in leaving them in silence, or feeding them on falsehoods.

The Civilian Voice Branch will not weaken the republic; it will complete it. For when the people speak in chorus, government is reminded of its sacred duty: not to rule over, but to serve. And in that remembrance, liberty itself is preserved.
