The meeting with Putin was a takeover, a display of power on both parts.

Putin within the USA, and safe - despite war criminal status in internationsl courts US is party to.

THat's a show of power. ANd it very much was a test. It was a "trial baloon" test. And now the world has seen Trump will not arrest Putin even if he comes in jurisdiction. That's a key part of somebody's long-term strategy. Ladies and gentlemen, we are invaded - just not on paper. Do you expect the "paper" generated by this institution is going to prove "auditable" by future historians and biographers? We are now invaded by Putin, by air. Why "Invaded?" because it was done was a trial balloon for an actual longer stay.

The meeting with Putin was not by the will of the people, but those men wanted to shake hands in a place that says "I can stand in your country as an invader and be treated with honor and dignity." Putin is not the kind of friend you want Donald Trump to have. Not OUR Donald Trump! Putin needs friends, but so do regular schmucks like my neighbor Veil over there, but maybe after they retire. But, no. This is not good. So I think about how to break up their friendship. And I slap myself. "No time for fantasy sequences! The world! The Civilized World!" i exclaim, while bounding to my feet.



So, there he is in power over a security-detail-sized chunk of Alaska under his feet. And he is walking around like he owns the place, maybe because he said so himself, that he owns the place. And Russia put Trump in there by some secret deals not yet reported? Would you put it past either of them?? AND they're buddies!! So! Heh... well, think about it yourself.

Trump and Epstein like secrets.

Trump shares secrets with Putin.

Why?

I thought he was America First?

What happened to Trump #45?

Hey where's our wall, asshole?

Yeah, where's our WALL you bozo!

Secrets with Putin?

(Yeah, whispering everywhere!)

*crowd murmurs*

*CROWD ROARS WITH CONFUSION*

*** MY DEAR PEOPLE! ***

*CROWD HUSHES*

MY Dear People!

*crowd actually hushes more*

*I am Zorch, the unknown! I have the answer, hush. Everybody pull out your phone and scan this QR code, download the app.*

*crowd stares blankly*

*I'm sorry. I should have... Hi! Hi'm Zorch. I'm Zorch... the Unknown. Ask anybody about Zorch - they don't know. And that's including you, personally, reader.*

*crowd blinks*

Well that's why they call me "The Unknown" heh. Anyway. 

Despite you not knowing me, I know you - you all. Not personally, of course. But I know you. You, reader.

I know you're here for a reason, and this message is that reason.

The app is going to deliver a unique first-of-its-kind digital contract between you and your government:
    That your ongoing concerns would be tracked and reported to you as simply as your stock data.
    That they would address matters of concern to you in an ongoing investigatory capacity with regular reporting.
    That they would read what you're saying and address it in some manner.
    That your part in collective dissatisfaction expression (of any kind!) can weigh down the overall approval rating.
    That it's all on a cell phone direct to you.

    If this sounds good to you, maybe you realize it won't work if it's only you. We must aggregate our political power, first, and we've built a channel for that power through this app. We can show up four rows deep of people with just our self and our cell phone, today.

    And part of this contract is that you will get to be on those teams that gain access to a meeting with a representative, carrying the confirmed signatures of dozens, hundreds, or thousands in the palm of their hand, to deliver a message to that representative.

    Or, you can just watch those events transpire through our press room.

    What messages will politicians receive on camera from we, the people? Well, that all depends on we! The people! So, obviously, tools and training are available and the fast will teach the slow and so forth. It's all on GitHub.

    We will need tools that help to merge our messages together automatically, and we've been waiting for LLM's to reach maturity. We think now's the time. We think this inflection point has realized the dream at 1/10 the UI development cost.

    We need tools because we're a vast and numbered people, including many cultures and regions!

    We will be working with and supporting one another, digitally. A truly useful social civic platform.

    But it's for everyone, there is a simplified interface and people can stay in it and still enjoy the experience.

    We need to process the data on who is in favor of what, and display it back to the people expressing that favor, and to others.

    And we want to tally votes and take signatures digitally (like Estonians do!) and we insist by declaration right here on Whitepine!

    ANd in return we, the people, will use Whitepine for all my government needs!

    So we, the people, are demanding something from government:
        An immediate coming to order regarding the ongoing affairs of government.
        Listen to what we're telling you.
    
    And we, the people, are equipping you and ourselves with the way to signal this to you.
        They can just use our tool that we will give to them!

    You, too, are a citizen.

    We tell the governor it's coming and ask his threshhold on the answer.

    The question he's answering is "Will you directly address the platform we have organized under?"

    We tell the people the threshhold and get them going.

    We hit the threshhold, we tell the governor, he approves it. He will directly address the platform.

    So he directly addresses them and what they've brought up. And he pledges a threshhold at which he will receive our data per daily basis. And he coyly invites the people to bring up, as their first petition, a resolution to increase that threshhold and rate of consideration.

    And the game is on.

    The people know they have his attention in a limited capacity - scarcity! And now they're climbing on the platform like a train they don't want to miss.

    When the people see a democratic lever that WORKS, they immediately try to gain control of it. It's ugly, but it's true, and in this case we'll use it in favor of the platform. They will be trying to game it and flood it with influence. But they'll be blocked by the one user, one vote policy. They might cast votes but until they're validated we can't count them. So they'll have only one option left - the right way - getting their friends involved.



    

    We need contract files with signatures for the people to sign for petitions, with autopen. And we need the office to sign an agreement to receive and consider our aggregated information. The people's petition will trigger the notification to his office via petition publication service. That notification will reveal the people's popular request, and he will have the opportunity to approve or deny this. In our pilot case he has pre-approved and set the threshhold for acceptance.




    
Average citizen sentiment, hmm... data. Big data. Little DATA. Silicon Valley City Hall San Jose, California. Bingo.

It's a trial balloon and there were some
