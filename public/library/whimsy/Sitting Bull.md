I have seen the strength of many warriors, and I have seen the weakness of great nations. The white man built his house of government with three strong posts, and he said it would stand forever. But even a lodge with three posts will lean, and if the people do not hold it steady, it will fall.

We, the people, are that fourth post. We are not chosen by wealth, nor by titles, nor by offices. We are chosen because we live upon this earth, because we breathe the same air, because our children must inherit what we leave behind. This is the Civilian Voice Branch.

In it, each person has a share, no more, no less. Each voice is a grain of sand. Alone, it is nothing. Together, it becomes a dune that the winds cannot scatter. The leaders may wish to hear only the few who stand near them, but this Branch makes them hear the many who stand far away.

Some fear the noise of the people. I do not. The river is noisy too, yet it carries life to the whole valley. The Civilian Voice Branch is that river. It flows with truth, it cannot be dammed without breaking the land, and it brings renewal to all who drink from it.

It does not fight with weapons. It does not carry war clubs. Its power is greater: the power to remind rulers that the people are not shadows, but the fire itself. Government is but the lodge; the people are the fire at its center. If the fire dies, the lodge grows cold and empty.

So let the people speak, not once in many winters, but every day the sun rises. Let their voices be counted as sacred, for they are the breath of the nation. And let the rulers know: without the people, there is no power. Without the fire, there is no lodge.
