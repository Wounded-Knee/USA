Civilian Voice Papers No. 1

On Liberty and the People’s Branch

To my fellow Americans:

For too long, power in this country has been concentrated in Washington, D.C., where lobbyists and special interests shape policy in ways that rarely reflect the will of the people. The Founders warned us against this. They created a Constitution to restrain government, not the people. They envisioned a republic where liberty was secured by checks and balances.

But let us be honest: the three branches we inherited have drifted. They too often serve the few, not the many. Elections once every few years are not enough to keep them honest.

That is why I believe in a Civilian Voice Branch: a way for Americans everywhere to testify their views, day by day, on the public record. It is voluntary. It is decentralized. It is open. And it makes clear, without spin, what the people actually believe.

This Branch has no coercive power. It doesn’t raise taxes. It doesn’t regulate. It doesn’t declare war. What it does is shine a light — on government abuse, on unconstitutional wars, on reckless spending. When millions speak together, the politicians can no longer pretend they have “consent of the governed” for policies that the people never wanted.

Skeptics may ask, “Can the people be trusted?” My answer is the same as Jefferson’s: “If we think them not enlightened enough, the remedy is not to take power from them, but to inform their discretion.” The Civilian Voice Branch is not mob rule — it is the orderly, peaceful expression of a free people.

Let this Branch be the conscience of the republic. Let it remind every officeholder that liberty belongs to the people, and that government must remain the servant, never the master.
