Federalist No. 87

On the Cooperative Genius of the Civilian Voice Branch

To the People of the United States:

It hath been observed that the existing branches of our Government are constituted by delegation. The people choose representatives, who then frame the laws; they elevate magistrates, who then execute them; and they appoint judges, who then expound them. Each branch, though sprung from the people, is in practice separated from the daily hand of the people.

But there is now conceived a fourth, a Civilian Voice Branch, not by delegation, but by direct co-operation. It is not the artifice of party, nor the patronage of wealth, but the concert of the citizen body itself. Each man and woman, by a simple act of record, joins his sentiment to the multitude, and the multitude in turn becomes a power of persuasion no officer can gainsay.

This Branch is therefore a co-operative commonwealth of voices. Its officers are none other than the citizens themselves; its charter is no parchment sealed by clerks, but the mutual covenant that every participant shall both speak and be counted. It admits no oligarchs, it entertains no lobby, it receives no favor but the truth of numbers honestly tallied.

What advantage is found in such a constitution? First, that it cannot be monopolized, for each has but one shareâ€”the measure of his own conscience. Second, that it cannot be corrupted, for its record is public and its testimony collective. Third, that it cannot be silenced, for its organ is the voice of millions, and its chorus resounds through every channel of society.

Some will fear that such a cooperative branch will dissolve into cacophony. But consider: the cacophony already exists. The newspapers teem with partial claims; the assemblies echo with factional cries. The virtue of the cooperative branch is not to still these voices, but to weave them into a fabric visible to all. In seeing the aggregate, the noise becomes sense, and the multitude becomes unity.

Thus, the Civilian Voice Branch is a co-operative enterprise of sovereignty. It is the people not only electing their governors once in a season, but governing themselves in constant chorus. By such a means, the republic acquires a new safeguard: for when the people are organized, government must forever remain their servant.
