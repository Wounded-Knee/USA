# Database Schema Specification
Built in the USA, by the USA, for the USA.

## Models

### Users
Can be anybody. Some users have a political demographic exposing them to a particular route of representation. We will collect demographic, residential, and statistical data relating directly to users which provides determination of their route of representation. We will store their data responsibly, encrypted or hashed as appropriate.
Other users are outside all US jurisdiction, but these are still welcome within the app at a limited scope.
